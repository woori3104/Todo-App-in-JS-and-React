# Todo-App-in-JS-and-React

JavaScript vs React.js: To-Do List Comparison
This repository contains two versions of a To-Do List application: one built using vanilla JavaScript, and another using React.js. It serves as a comparative study to demonstrate the differences and similarities between the two methods.

## Project Structure
The project consists of two main directories: js-todo and react-todo.

## js-todo: 
- This directory contains the vanilla JavaScript version of the application. It includes an HTML file (index.html), a JavaScript file (index.js), and a CSS file (styles.css).

## react-todo: 
- This directory contains the React.js version of the application. It was created using create-react-app and follows the standard project structure.

## Getting Started
To get started with the JavaScript version, open the index.html file in your browser.

To start the React version, navigate to the react-todo directory in your terminal and run the following command:

clone code
npm install
npm start
This will install the necessary dependencies and start the React development server.

## Observations
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the differences between building an application with vanilla JavaScript and with a modern framework like React.js. While both can achieve the same results, the way they handle state, components, and updates can vary significantly.

Feel free to explore both versions of the application to gain a better understanding of these differences.
